# CS1 Final Project - [Project Title]

## 1. Overview
- What problem does your project solve?  
- Briefly describe the purpose and key features of your program.  

My program allows the user to order parts individually or have a desktop be built from parts they choose. They are also given the option of reading in a file.

## 2. Design Decisions
- What fundamental programming constructs and data types did you use, and why?  
- Why did you choose to structure your data using structs?  
- How did you implement searching and sorting? What algorithms did you use and why?  
- How do you ensure data persistence between program runs?  
- Did you consider alternative approaches? If so, why did you not use them?  

I decided to use a class instead of a struct. I used a class for the added security and easier access to the variables by functions in the same class. I could not implement searching and sorting although due to the nature of my program it would be strange to implement one. I ensured data persistence by allowing the user to save and read in files in theory although it did not end up working. I did consider alternative approaches but due to time constraints i could not implement them.

## 3. Testing Summary
- **Structured Testing Log:** Include a table with test cases, expected output, actual output, and pass/fail status.  
- What testing methods did you use?  
- Provide examples of test inputs (valid and invalid) and describe how your program responds.  

I had not created a test log.

## 4. Technical Walkthrough
- Explain the main functionality of your program.  
- **Include a link to your required video demonstration** showcasing how the project works (**3-7 minutes**). 
    Make sure it shareable without approval needed.

## 5. Challenges and Lessons Learned
- What challenges did you encounter while working on this project?  
- What key lessons did you learn about programming and problem-solving?  

I faced some challenges of some code not reacting in the way i had originally intended or the difficulty of managing code after it grows too large. I learned to adapt to unexpected problems and to think outside the box to solve difficult problems.

## 6. Future Improvements
- If you had more time, what changes or enhancements would you make?  
I would have liked to use headers to break my code into pieces to make the whole thing easier to read if i had more time. I would also like to have been able and go back to add features that I missed.
